            <p>I am a developer enthusiast with a passion for programming.
                ReactJS and Android development are my specialities.
                Throughout my career as a software developer, I have focused on developing 
                scalable and well-documented code. 
                I enjoy working collaboratively but can also run with projects independently. 
                Excited about the prospect of joining a product-driven company.
